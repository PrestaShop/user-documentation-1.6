### Best practices for writing an issue <a href="#howtousetheforgetocontributetoprestashop-bestpracticesforwritinganissue" id="howtousetheforgetocontributetoprestashop-bestpracticesforwritinganissue"></a>

When writing a bug report, please use these guidelines:

* Make sure you can reproduce your bug every time.
* Make sure your software is up to date.
  * Ideally, test an in-development version to see whether your bug has already been fixed.
* Search the Forge to see whether your bug has already been reported.
* Write a clear summary.
* Write precise steps to reproduce. Be specific and verbose: do not fear to give details on how you did reproduce the bug.
  * After your steps, precisely describe the observed result and the expected result.
