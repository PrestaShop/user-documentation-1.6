# 1.6-specific Developer Documentation

Version 1.6 of PrestaShop is an evolution of version 1.5: while a lot has changed on the surface, the core of the software remains the same – only tightened and sturdier.

Hence, any module that works in version 1.5 should work as-is in version 1.6 – though it really helps if it uses the Helper class to build its interface rather than custom HTML.

That being said, version 1.6 does bring a slew of improvement to the module API, most notably with the adjunction of Bootstrap to the default interface and theme. These new features and practices in the following chapters:
