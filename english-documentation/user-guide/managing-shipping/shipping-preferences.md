The more general settings of you shop's shipping configuration are found in the "Shipping" page, under the "Shipping" menu.

This page provides handling charges settings:

* **Handling charges**. Enter the per-order handling expenses, which will be added to the final purchase price. This is separate from your shipping costs: it is really the cost of you or your employee having to fetch the products, package them and have them shipped. If there is no such cost, leave it at 0.
* **Free shipping starts at (currency)** and **Free shipping starts at (weight)**. Enter the price or weight after which your customers will receive free shipping. For instance, you might choose to offer free shipping when the order exceeds $250. A message will appear to your customers indicating how much more money they need to spend in order to receive free shipping.\
  &#x20;If you do not want to offer free shipping and you do not want this message to appear, leave these values at 0.

The "Carrier options" section gives you access to 3 settings, which impact the front office in order to help the customer make a choice:

* **Default carrier**. If you have more than one carrier in your system, you might want to promote one to your customers. Besides the carriers themselves, this drop-down list has two contextual options:
  * **Best price**. Depending on the amount of the order, on its weight and its delivery zone, PrestaShop will choose the cheapest price for the customer.
  * **Best grade**. Speed grades make it easier to identify the fasted carriers. PrestaShop will display the carrier which, within the context of the order, will have the shortest shipping delay.
* **Sort by**. When customers are presented with a choice of carriers, you can choose to either sort the list by shipping price or by their position, as set in the carrier list on the "Carriers" page.
* **Order by**. This enables to set the order in which the carriers are sorted:
  * If sorted by shipping fee and with an ascending order, then carriers will be displayed from the cheapest to the most expensive.
  * If sorted by position and with a descending order, then carriers will be displayed from the top position of the list, to the bottom position.
