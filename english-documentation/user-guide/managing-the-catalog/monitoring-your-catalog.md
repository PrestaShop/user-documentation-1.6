# Monitoring Your Catalog

The "Monitoring" page lists the sections of your shop to which you must pay the most attention in order to best manage your catalog, and make sure nothing goes out of control.

Four sections are shown:

* **List of empty categories**. Gives you the categories that do not have any products. You should either delete these empty categories, or fill them with at least one product. This prevents customers from finding themselves in an empty category in your shop.
* **List of products with attributes and without available quantities for sale**. Gives you which products are no longer for sale. If you do not see any good reason for them not being for sale, then put them back online
* **List of products without attributes and without available quantities for sale**. Likewise, gives you which products are no longer for sale. Find the reason why, or put them back up.
* **List of disabled products**. Gives you the products that have been disabled in the store and that aren't visible to your customers. Consider either enabling them (maybe after restocking them) or deleting them from your catalog.

The "Monitoring" page should be checked regularly in order to improve your catalog management.
