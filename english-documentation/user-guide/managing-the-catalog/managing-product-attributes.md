# Managing Product Attributes

Attributes are the basis of product variations (or "combinations" in PrestaShop's interface): you can only create variations of a product if at least one of its attributes changes.\
You should think of attributes as properties of a product that may change between variations, while still keeping the same product name: color, capacity, size, weight, etc. You can use anything that varies between versions of the same product, except the price.

The difference between an attribute and a feature depends on the product itself. Some products might share the same property, one being an attribute built for building product variations, another one being simply an invariable feature.

For instance, a customer can buy an iPod variation based on attributes (color, disk space) but not on features (weight, size).

Likewise, another shop might sell t-shirts variations based on attributes (color, size, gender) but not on features (weight).

Attributes are configured on a per-product basis, from the "Products" page under the "Catalog" menu, but they must first be registered on your shop using the tool on the "Product Attributes" page under the "Catalog" menu.

This page presents a list of all your currently registered attributes. You can edit or delete each using the actions on the right of the table, or display their values by clicking on the "View" action, which opens a new table.

You can also set the attributes front office presentation order by clicking on the arrow icons, or by drag-and-dropping each row when the mouse hovers the "Position" column.

To add an attribute, or in other words, to add a group of variation possibilities (colors, capacity, material, etc.), click on "Add new attribute". A new page appears.

Fill out the form:

* **Name**. The exact description of the attribute. This needs to be short but precise, so as to not confuse it with another attribute.
* **Public name**. The attribute name, as displayed to the customers on the product page. Since some attributes might have the same name for varying content, this field enables you to still present it correctly within the product's context, while being able to easily tell an attribute from another with a similar name but different meaning.
* **Attribute type**. Enables you to choose whether the product's page should display this attribute's values as a drop-down list, a radio button list, or a color picker.

Three more options are available when you enable the Layered Navigation Block module. They are not strictly tied to the layered navigation: they provide a direct URL to each of a product's variations. This way, not only is the customer able to send a correct link to a friend, but this also helps enhance your search engine placement.

* **URL**. The word to use in the URL. By default, PrestaShop uses the attribute's public name.
* **Meta title**. The word to use in the page's title. By default, PrestaShop uses the attribute's public name.
* **Indexable**. Whether search engines should index this attribute or not.

The customer can get the URL simply by clicking on an attribute from the product sheet: the URL will change to add a final detail, for instance `#/color-metal` or `#/disk_space-16gb/color-green`.

The layered navigation generator does make use of these too, hence the description text "Specific URL format in block layered generation" and "Use this attribute in URL generated by the layered navigation module".

Save your new attribute to return to the attributes list. You must now add values to your attribute.

## Creating a new value <a href="#managingproductattributes-creatinganewvalue" id="managingproductattributes-creatinganewvalue"></a>

Click on "Add new value". A new page appears.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/30245488 (1).png>)

Fill out the form:

* **Attribute type**. From the dropdown list, select one of the available attributes.
* **Value**. Give a value to the attribute: "Red", "16 Gb", "1.21 gigowatts"...

The next fields are only shown if the attribute is a color type.

* **Color**. If the attribute is a color, you can enter its value in HTML color code (i.e. "#79ff52" or "lightblue"), or use the color picker to precisely show the correct hue.
* **Texture**. If your product does not use a solid color but rather a textured one (i.e. tiger stripes), you can upload a small image file that will be displayed on the product's page. Note that this will replace the HTML color from the field above. Click on the "Save" button is order to start the upload.\
  You can also use this option to let the customer choose color variety from a picture of your product rather than a color. How it is displayed on the front-end depends on the theme you are using...
* **Current texture**. Once you have uploaded a texture file, it is displayed in this section as a reminder.

You can add more values for the same attribute type by saving your changes with the "Save then add another value" button.

Two more options are available when you enable the Layered Navigation Block module. They are not strictly tied to the layered navigation: they provide a direct URL to each of a product's variations. This way, not only is the customer able to send a correct link to a friend, but this also helps enhance your search engine placement.

* **URL**. The word to use in the URL. By default, PrestaShop uses the value's name.
* **Meta title**. The word to use in the URL. By default, PrestaShop uses the value's name.

The customer can get the URL simply by clicking on an attribute from the product sheet, and the URL will change to add a final detail, for instance `#/color-metal` or `#/disk_space-16gb/color-green`.

The layered navigation generator does make use of these too, hence the "Specific URL format in block layered generation" description text.

Once your attributes are in place and their values are set, you can create product variations (or "combinations") in each product's "Combinations" tab, from the "Products" page under the "Catalog" menu.
