# Creating Price Rules and Vouchers

Vouchers play an important role in your daily relationships with your customers. Typically, customers like two things when shopping:

* Feeling special, unique.
* Getting good prices.

Both can be achieved with personalized discounts, and this is precisely where vouchers come into play â€“ or more precisely, price rules.

"Price rules" can take two forms:

* **Cart rules**. These are actually the successors to vouchers, as they were known in previous versions of PrestaShop.\
  &#x20;Basically, it enables you to create per-customer voucher codes, but also much more.
* **Catalog price rules**. Enables you to assign price reductions by category, manufacturer, supplier, attribute or feature.\
  &#x20;For instance, you can set a rule that would say that for Spanish customers belonging to the "Good clients" group would get 10% off on your Electronics category and all Sony products for the first week of July.
