The modules in this page come from the "Advertising and Marketing" and "Smart Shopping" sections in the "Modules" page.

You can install modules directly from this page. When you click the "install" button, the module is installed and you are taken to the "Modules" page, where you can open the module's configuration page by clicking on its "Configure" link. You can also return to the "Marketing" page in order to open the configuration page, or delete, disable, reset or uninstall the module, depending on its status.
