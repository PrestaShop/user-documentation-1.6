# Understanding Local Settings

As obvious as it might seem, this is the Internet, and people from all over the world will certainly visit your shop, and order your products. As a shop owner, you must cater for as many customers as possible. This means having your website fully translated in as many languages as necessary, with local taxes, weights and currency units, local geographical zones, etc.

The "Localization" menu appeared with PrestaShop 1.5, and brings together many local settings and tools that used to be scattered in other menus in previous versions.

This chapter contains the following sections:

* [Localization](localization.md)
* [Languages](languages.md)
* [Zones](zones.md)
* [Countries](countries.md)
* [States](states.md)
* [Currencies](currencies.md)
* [Taxes](taxes.md)
* [Tax Rules](tax-rules.md)
* [Translations](translations.md)
