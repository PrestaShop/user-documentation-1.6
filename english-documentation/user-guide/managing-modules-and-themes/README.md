# Managing Modules and Themes

PrestaShop 1.6 comes bundled with over 120 modules that can be installed/uninstalled and configured as desired, in order to customize and complete your shop.

The range of actions is virtually unlimited: the extensibility of PrestaShop makes it possible to turn your shop into exactly what you intend it to do, instead of you having to comply with constraints that you did not choose â€“ provided you can find the module that does exactly what you need.
