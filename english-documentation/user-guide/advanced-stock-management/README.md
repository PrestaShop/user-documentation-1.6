# Advanced Stock Management

PrestaShop features a complete stock management feature: more than just merely listing how much of a specific product you have currently available, this menu enables you to list warehouses and get a proper view of your stock, its movement, your coverage, your stock orders, etc.

Not all merchants will have a need for this feature. It is therefore optional, and the classic "available quantity management" tool is still available.

You can enable the advanced management menu by going to the "Products" preferences page, at the bottom of which is the "Products stock" section. Select "Yes" for the "Enable advanced stock management" option.
