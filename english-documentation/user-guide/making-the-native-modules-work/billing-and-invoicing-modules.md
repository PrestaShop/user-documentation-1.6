## European VAT Number <a href="#billing-and-invoicingmodules-europeanvatnumber" id="billing-and-invoicingmodules-europeanvatnumber"></a>

This module enables your customers to fill in their VAT number in their details. The VAT can be fetched through a web service, based on your country.

The configuration screen is therefore quite straightforward:

* **Your country**. Choose your shop's country.
* **Enable checking of the VAT number with the WebService**. Tell PrestaShop that you want to retrieve the VAT for your country.

The VAT field appears only when the customer enters his or her company name in the address field.
