This module helps you build a sitemap for your shop, and keep it up to date.

In order to optimize your SEO, it is essential to have a sitemap, which is a XML file that lists all the products and pages on your shop. This file will enable search engines to index all pages easily and efficiently. Your products will then appear perfectly in the search engines when a visitor conducts a search. You can create a sitemap for PrestaShop, and be indexed by all the search engines that support the file format (Google, Yahoo, Bing...), using tools such as Google's Webmaster Tools.

The configuration page has few options: indicate how often your store (including the catalog and the CMS page) is updated on average, check the boxes of the page you do not want to include in the sitemap, and click the "Generate Sitemap" button.

Once you have finished configuring the module, click on "Update sitemap file". You are then given the Sitemap's address (e.g., [myprestashop.com/sitemap.xml](http://myprestashop.com/sitemap.xml)). Copy this URL to save it to your Google Webmaster Tools account. The module will then show you the file size and the number of pages indexed. Remember to update it regularly so that search engines index your content perfectly.

The last part of the configuration page gives a cron link. A good sitemap is an updated one, and unless you are willing to click on the "Update sitemap file" button every time there is a change on your shop, you might want to have your server do the work for you. Create a cron task with the given URL, and never worry about this again.\
&#x20;If you do not know what a cron task is, ask your web host.
