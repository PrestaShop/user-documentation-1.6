# Advertising and Marketing modules

## Advertising block <a href="#advertisingandmarketingmodules-advertisingblock" id="advertisingandmarketingmodules-advertisingblock"></a>

This module will display a block on the front office of your shop, containing the image of your choice, with a link to any URL you choose. This is a very easy way to promote another site: your blog, another store of yours, a friend or partner site, etc.

In the configuration page, you can load an image, set the target URL, and add a title to the image. Save and the image will appear to all your visitors.

## Customer follow-up <a href="#advertisingandmarketingmodules-customerfollow-up" id="advertisingandmarketingmodules-customerfollow-up"></a>

This module enables you to create e-mail alerts for your customers. It gives you a way to automatically send discount vouchers to some of your customers.

There are four types of event that can trigger the sending of a voucher:

* Canceled cart: generate a discount when a cart does not become an order.
* Validated order: generate a discount when an order is validated.
* Frequent customer: generate a discount when the customer reaches a certain number of orders.
* Lost customer: generate a discount when a customer, who has already ordered once, has not come back to your site since.

Please note that the "Canceled cart" and "Validated order" options can dangerous. For instance, a customer might quickly notice he receives a discount every time he abandons a cart, and thus choose to frequently abandon his carts in order to receive a voucher...

This module will only work if you put a new cron task in place: it should daily call the URL that is indicated at the top of the screen.

Alternatively, you could call that URL manually every day â€“ but this would quickly get tedious.

At the bottom of the screen, you will find two sections:

* General: has a single option, "Delete outdated discounts during each launch to clean database". If enabled, its action is triggered every time the URL is called.
* Statistics: displays the number of discounts set during the last 30 days.

## Referral program <a href="#advertisingandmarketingmodules-referralprogram" id="advertisingandmarketingmodules-referralprogram"></a>

This module gives you all the tools to turn your current customers into promoters of your brand among their friends. Using a referral system, you can win new customers while making your customers happier.

The configuration screen has two sections. Here are the options in the "Settings" section:

* **Minimum number of orders a sponsored friend must place to get their voucher**. Fill in the field with the value of your choice. Until this number is reached, your clients cannot take advantage of the discount.
* **Number of friends in the referral program invitation form**. Fill in the value of your choice.
* **Voucher type**. You can give two types of reduction, either in percentage or amount. Select the one you prefer, then specify the value of the discount you want to apply in the various currencies supported by your shop.
  * **Percentage**. Default voucher is 5% of the order.
  * **Voucher amount**. Default voucher is 5 of every currency.
* **Voucher description**. Enter the name for the coupon, in all the supported languages.

Once the setup is complete, click the "Save" button.

The "conditions of the referral program" is where you enter the rules of your referral program, which is a new CMS page where you can set some limits to the voucher, such as " The voucher is valid for 1 year".

### Understanding the referral process <a href="#advertisingandmarketingmodules-understandingthereferralprocess" id="advertisingandmarketingmodules-understandingthereferralprocess"></a>

To fully explain how the referral program works, you can write a description in the "Referral Program Rules." Once the conditions are completed, click the "Update text" button.

When your customers register and want to view the benefits they can reap from this program, they must go to the "Referral" section of their account. A new screen will appear.

Your customer can then enter the name and email address of the person he wishes to refer to your site. After he clicks "Confirm," the persons he entered will receive an email.

In "Pending Friends", the referral tool displays to the customer which of his referrals did not make a purchase after the email was sent. They may choose to resend an email by selecting the name and clicking "Refer my friends". Friends will then receive an email inviting them to register and submit an order.

The last tab in "my referrals", named "Friends I have sponsored", enables customers to see who among those to whom they sent a referral message, did accept the invitation and ordered an item on the shop. When registering, the referees must indicate the email address of the person who referred them, so that they in turn may benefit from the discount.
