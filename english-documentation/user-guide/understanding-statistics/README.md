# Understanding Statistics

One of the greatest aspects of PrestaShop is its unrivaled power in digging up information on customer behavior. Let's see how this is done.

Contrary to the popular saying, statistics are not akin to "lies and damned lies". The numbers PrestaShop provides you with are rock-solid information which you can count on to improve your shop, change the way products are presented or adapt their prices, remove products that do not sell or simply push forward those that do. All this and more can be deduced from the data that PrestaShop automatically gathers for you, and which is presented in a dozen of entries, with graphics and data tables helping you making decisions.\
&#x20;The point to all this is to help you make a solid decision when you need to target your audience.

In addition to this, PrestaShop has a built-in referrer management system, which makes it possible for you to easily create affiliate campaigns.
