# Development Troubleshooting -

If your module does not work as expected, here are a few ways to find help.

## Make sure your code is valid! <a href="#developmenttroubleshooting-makesureyourcodeisvalid" id="developmenttroubleshooting-makesureyourcodeisvalid"></a>

PrestaShop has built a special online tool to help you discover possible issues within your code.

You can access it here: [https://validator.prestashop.com/auth](https://validator.prestashop.com/auth)

Make sure to validate your module before you submit it to the Addons marketplace! Indeed, the Addons team will refuse to accept a module that is not at least valid.

## PrestaShop official forum <a href="#developmenttroubleshooting-prestashopofficialforum" id="developmenttroubleshooting-prestashopofficialforum"></a>

Join our forums at [http://www.prestashop.com/forums/](http://www.prestashop.com/forums/), and search for an answer using the relevant keywords. If your search needs refining, use the advanced search form. And if your search doesn't yield anything useful, create a new thread, where you can be as wordy as necessary when writing your question; you will need to register first.

Some forums keep certain threads pinned on top of all threads; they contain some useful information, so be sure to read them through.

## Our bug-tracker <a href="#developmenttroubleshooting-ourbug-tracker" id="developmenttroubleshooting-ourbug-tracker"></a>

If it turns out your issue stems from a PrestaShop bug rather than your code, please do submit the issue in the PrestaShop bug-tracker: [http://forge.prestashop.com/](http://forge.prestashop.com/) (you will need to register). This enables you to discuss the issue directly with the PrestaShop developers.
