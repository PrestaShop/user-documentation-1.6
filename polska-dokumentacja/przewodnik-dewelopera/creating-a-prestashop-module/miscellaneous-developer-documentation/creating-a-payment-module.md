# Creating a payment module -

## Principles <a href="#creatingapaymentmodule-principles" id="creatingapaymentmodule-principles"></a>

A payment module is a regular PrestaShop module, except that it extends the `PaymentModule` class instead of the `Module` class:

```
class MyOWnPaymentMethod extends PaymentModule
```

It can be attached to the following hooks:

* `payment`: to display the payment method.
* `paymentReturn`: to display the payment confirmation.

The handling of the payment itself is done through a controller or a remote server.

If you are using a remote server, a return URL makes it possible to execute a script from your module's folder in order to validate and register the payment.\

## Validating the payment <a href="#creatingapaymentmodule-validatingthepayment" id="creatingapaymentmodule-validatingthepayment"></a>

In order to register the payment validation, you must use the `validateOrder()` method from the `PaymentModule` class, using the following parameters:

* `Å¸(integer) id_cart`: the ID of the cart to validate.
* `(integer) id_order_state`: the ID of the order status (Awiting payment, Payment accepted, Payment error, etc.).
* `(float) amount_paid`: the amount that the client actually paid.
* `(string) payment_method`: the name of the payment method.

## Securing the module <a href="#creatingapaymentmodule-securingthemodule" id="creatingapaymentmodule-securingthemodule"></a>

Here are a few basic rules:

* ALWAYS use HTTPS when communicating with a server.
*   Check that the module is activated:

    ```
    if (!$this->active)
      return;
    ```
* Check that the module is valid for the customer's delivery address.
* NEVER trust foreign data.
